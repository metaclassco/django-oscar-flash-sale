# django-oscar-flash-sale

Showcase Oscar application with flash sale support.

Here added a new offer type - "Flash Sale". A user can create a "Flash Sale" for any product from the catalogue (in
the dashboard). All products from active "Flash Sale" will be properly marked in the catalogue and their detail pages
(will be shown "old" price, sale price and "on sale" icon).
